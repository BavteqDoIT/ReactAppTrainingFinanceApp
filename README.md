# React Native Learning – Section 8

This repository contains my code and notes for **Section 8** of the [React Native - The Practical Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-native-the-practical-guide/) course by Maximilian Schwarzmüller on Udemy.

## 📚 Section Overview

In this section, the course introduces important foundational concepts in React Native such as:

- **React Navigation** setup and usage

## 🚀 What I'm Learning

- How to install and configure React Navigation
- Stack Navigator basics
- Dynamic navigation using route parameters
- Navigating programmatically
- Building multi-screen apps
- Screen styling and header customization

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- React Native
- Expo
- React Navigation (Stack Navigator)

## 🧠 My Goals

- Get hands-on experience with screen navigation
- Build clean and understandable navigation flows
- Reinforce my understanding of component-based architecture in React Native
- Prepare for more complex navigation types (like bottom tabs and drawer)

## 📌 Notes

This repo is part of my ongoing learning journey. The code here may evolve or be improved over time as I revisit concepts and build on top of what I’ve learned.
